## Test Environment

### Expected Limitations

The following limitations are expected in the test environment and do not indicate failures:

1. **Plugin Warnings**: File picker plugin warnings are expected in test environment
2. **Path Provider**: MissingPluginException for path provider is expected without device
3. **Database Factory**: Database initialization warnings are normal in unit test context

These limitations do not affect the actual functionality and are handled gracefully by the backup system.
